<h2>What/Why/When/Who/Where is totallynuclear.club?</h2>

Totallynuclear.club is a simple, tiny linux machine run for social purposes inspired by Paul Ford’s <a href="http://tilde.club" target="_blank">tilde.club</a>. (You can read more about how all of that happened <a href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf" target="_blank">here</a>.) 

As a sysadmin of a tiny linux server back in college (mrfalcon.net) and a member of a less tiny and way more awesome linux server before that (berzerker.net), Ford’s Medium article made me nostalgic for those days and reminded me how valuable those experiences were for me (if for nothing else, to learn my way around the unix shell). A few beers later, tada!

I launched totallynuclear.club right around 2014-10-11T15:45:00-05:00

My name is Erik Price. I can be found on totallynuclear.club at <a href="http://totallynuclear.club/~erik" target="_blank">totallynuclear.club/~erik</a>

totallynuclear.club resides on an Amazon EC2 instance. I’m told somewhere in Virginia.


<h2>What is totallynuclear.club not?</h2>

A robust hosting platform where you should host critical content.


<h2>Where does the name “totally nuclear” come from?</h2>

That was the embarrassing reply I gave to a girl in 7th grade who told me that another girl had the hots for me. (I probably stole it from <a href="http://www.frozen-dreams.sk/dana_cody/episodes/s4_02_0065.jpg" target="_blank">Cody</a> on Step by Step, but that’s never been confirmed.)


<h2>What can I expect from totallynuclear.club?</h2>

I am copying and pasting this straight from Paul Ford’s Sacred Vows in his Medium article and pledge to do the same:

<ol type="1">
	<li>I will make a weekly backup of the public_html directories so when some teen in Estonia decides to hack in and ruin everything we can bring up a new server and limp back to life.</li>

	<li>I won’t shut things down without a month of warning and once it’s shut down I’ll make sure a file with all the public_html directories is uploaded to archive.org.</li>

	<li>If any community forms at all (DUBIOUS BUT SURPRISE ME) I promise I won’t blow up the community without, like, first pointing everyone to some free IRC channel or something.</li>
</ol>

Beyond that, you should know that this is a very informal project and subject to all sorts of uptime issues, unreliability of service and unreliability of attention from me.


<h2>The server is down! What do I do?</h2>

Wait. I almost certainly already know about it and am working on it. If you feel you must, you can hit me up on twitter at @erikprice (just once is good, thanks).


<h2>Can you install my favorite software?</h2> 

No.


<h2>What if I have a problem or something is busted?</h2>

Check out the Github repo and see if the issue already exists. If not, create it. https://github.com/totallynuclearclub/totallynuclear.club/issues


<h2>Are there any rules?</h2>

Don’t be a jerk. Jerks will be unceremoniously banned. You agreed not to be a jerk, remember?


<h2>What can I do with this thing?</h2>
<ol>
	<!--<li>Create a webpage. Here’s some step-by-step (heyo, callback!) directions for n00bs.</li>-->
	<li>Check out some recently updated pages for inspiration.</li>
	<li>See a list of users who are on the server with command ‘users’</li>
	<li>Message any totallynuclear.club member; type in ‘mutt’ to access the mail client or ‘talk whatever_username’ to chat directly.</li>
</ol>


<h2>How do I log in?</h2>
Open up terminal on your computer. Type in ssh your_username@totallynuclear.club and your temporary password (which should have been emailed to you).
You should change your password right away. Type in passwd, hit enter, and follow the prompts.
Set up public key authentication, which will soon be required. <a href="http://totallynuclear.club/~charles/" target="_blank">Here are directions</a> for enabling public key authentication.
